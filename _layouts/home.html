Hi.  I'm Curtis.  Last name Einsmann, like [Albert] <i>Einstein</i>, with <i>mann</i> instead of <i>stein</i>.  I'm a Software Development Engineer located in the Washington, D.C. area.  I just launched this site, so don't expect a whole lot of content yet.  I'll be writing blog posts from time to time, in between coding, playing basketball and practicing Stoic philosophy.
<br></br>
I work for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>, on the Security Tools and Platforms team.  If I'm blogging about AWS, it's as a <i>user</i> (AWS is a big company).  Lambda is pretty much the closest thing to magic that I've ever experienced.
