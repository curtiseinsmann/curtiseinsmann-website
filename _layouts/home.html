Hi.  I'm Curtis.  I'm a Software Development Engineer located in the Washington, D.C. area.  I just launched this site, so don't expect a whole lot of content yet.  I'll be writing blog posts from time to time, in between coding, playing basketball and practicing Stoic philosophy.
<br></br>
I work for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>.  Yes, that means I use AWS <strong>a lot</strong> (AWS Lambda is pretty much the closest thing to magic that I've ever experienced).  No, that doesn't mean that I have ownership over all AWS services.  It's a big company with a ton of engineers.  Therefore, <i>most of my blog posts about AWS are from the perspective of an AWS user.</i>
